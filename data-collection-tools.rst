Overview on Data Collection Tools
===================

KoBoToolbox allows data collection in multiple ways. Because KoBoToolbox is built on the Xform/ODK technology, our forms are compatible with a number of different tools that can be used for data collection. 

For Android devices, we recommend using KoBoCollect app, which can be downloaded from the Google Play Store and installed on any standard Android phone or tablet. (Note: Unfortunately, KoBoCollect app is currently unavailable on Apple App Store. )

For any other devices (including iPhones, iPads, or any laptop or computer), we recommend using the webform (Enketo) for collecting data.
