# Importing an XLSForm via URL

When importing an XLSForm via URL, please make sure that the URL points to the XLS file directly and that it is publicly accessible. A quick way to test this is to load the URL in a browser: it should trigger the download of the file. (If it loads a page in the browser, then it's not the right URL.)

Google Sheets
To get the correct link for a Google Sheets spreadsheet, follow these steps: 

Click on File > Publish to the Web.
Under the "Web Page" dropdown, select "Microsoft Excel (.xlsx)". Keep "Entire Document" selected in the preceding dropdown.
Copy the link from the resulting field
