# Adding Cascading Select Questions

Cascading select questions are sets of questions whose options depend on the response to a previous question. For example, your form may first ask the region where a respondent is from, and then in the next question list only the towns and villages of that region.
 
Adding sets of cascading select questions to your form can be done by importing them to a draft form in the formbuilder or adding them manually to an XLS Form and then uploading that file.

1. Open Excel or another spreadsheet program and create your template of questions and responses to be added.
2. [Follow this template as an example](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1C_uDOkjjbv5Kx3lyOY7ORwM-muW6BKVzdaPMB1X8-2A/edit#gid=0) and follow the instructions in the template.
3. Select and copy the whole cascading table template, then paste it into the Import Cascade, then click Done to import it. (If there were any mistakes in the formatting you will not be able to import the set - correct any formatting mistakes and make sure you followed the template instructions.)
4. You can move the imported questions anywhere in your form and change the labels of both the question and responses and delete responses.
5. If you want to add additional responses to the cascading list just delete the imported questions and import a new list from your spreadsheet.
