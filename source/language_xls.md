# Adding Another Language to your XLS Form

There are two methods to adding multiple languages to your form. You can either add and manage them directly through the online Project Dashboard or you can add them in an XLS Form and upload it to KoBo. 

Here are detailed instructions on how you can add another language to your form:

Create your form in the default language. This should be the language that the person responsible for designing the questionnaire is most comfortable with. When you are done, or when a significant portion of the form has been created, save it. You'll be returned to the draft form's project dashboard.
Export the form to XLS.
Open the file in Excel (Google Spreadsheet, Open Office Calc, etc will all work) [If you're in Excel it's possible you have to take the file out of Protected View first. See here.] Your spreadsheet will have three sheets (see the little tabs at the bottom): survey, choices, settings. Stay in the survey sheet for now.
Find the column called 'label'. This is where your original question labels are stored. Insert another column to the right of label. In the header (first row) of this new column, write label::language , for example label::Français  or  label::English . Note: you can change the size of your columns, add colors or change the font size, none of these will affect your form.
Then, if you have hints in your form, the same needs to apply to that hint column, for example  hint::Français  or  hint::English .
