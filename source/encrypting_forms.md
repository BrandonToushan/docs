# Encrypting Forms

_This procedure is quite technical and is intended for users who are comfortable with advanced technical instructions and requires strict attention to detail._ 

Encrypted forms work by encrypting the data on the phone the moment it is saved. Data sent to KoBoToolbox is encrypted and completely inaccessible to anyone not possessing the private key. In this case, KoBoToolbox serves simply as a storage locker for your encrypted files - a place to upload and then download for later for local decryption ([using ODK Briefcase](http://blog.formhub.org/2013/06/27/formhub-supports-odk-briefcase/)). Since the form submissions are encrypted, it means, however, anything that requires access to the data like the map view or data export won't work within KoBoToolbox. The extra level of security makes using KoBoToolbox in a way to collect sensitive data while meeting certain data protection protocols possible.
