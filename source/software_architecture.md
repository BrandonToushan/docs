# Software architecture

KoBoToolbox consists of the following components, all of which are open source (see links for source code):

kpi - for creating survey forms and reusing assets through a question library
kobocat and kobocat-templates - for deploying surveys, collecting, and analyzing data
enketo-express - HTML5 Web app for collecting data, previewing forms, editing data submissions
kobocollect - Android app for collecting data
KoBoToolbox is based on elements from several other open source tools, most importantly pyxform, formhub/onadata, and the OpenDataKit. As a result, all forms and collected data are compatible with these tools.
