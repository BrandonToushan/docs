# Record Validation

A Project owner can now give a “Can Validate” permission to other users. Users with this permission can view a record, edit it if necessary, and assign a status to the record in question. Assigning a status to a particular record/submission raises data collection standards for teams with more than one enumerator. 

What are the statuses that you can assign to a record?

The validation status labels available include: 

On Hold: Record is under review.
Approved: The data within this record is accurate.
Flagged for Removal: The data within this record should be removed from the data set.
Functionality Overview
This new permission adds a “Validated” column to your project's data table.
