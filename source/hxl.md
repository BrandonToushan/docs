**What exactly is HXL?**

HXL stands for Humanitarian Exchange Language. The goal of HXL is to improve information sharing during a humanitarian crisis by creating a simple way to promote interoperablity of data. It does this by coding the data through hashtags (#) similar to Twitter. For more information on HXL, please visit: http://hxlstandard.org/
