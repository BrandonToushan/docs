# Grouping Questions and Repeating Groups

Groups are collection of one or more questions inside a form. Groups can also be grouped themselves. There are many scenarios when using groups can be useful:

A large form can be divided into multiple large sections
Several questions can be skipped by grouping them and setting a single Skip logic condition
A set of questions should be repeated indefinitely for every unit, such as members of a household
A set of questions should be displayed together on the same screen during data entry
Creating Groups and Displaying Multiple Questions on the Same Screen
To create a group just select one question, then click the Group Questions button. Then, drag and drop the other questions in your form that you want included in this group.
