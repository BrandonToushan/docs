# Question Matrix response type

![image](/images/matrix_response/matrix_example.png)

The Question Matrix response type allows users to create a group of questions that display in a matrix format, whereby each cell within the matrix represents a separate question. To use this response type, define the number of rows and columns you want in your matrix set and give each row and column a label or name. Each column can be a different question type. In the above screenshot, the first two columns are select-one questions, and the third column is a number question. 

NOTE: This response type only works when using Enketo, utilizing the Grid-theme layout. Forms are set to single page layout by default -- to change it, find the "layout" button in the formbuilder toolbar, select "grid-theme", save this change, and redeploy your form to make these changes live.
